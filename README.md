# Gist Scanner


Using the Github API query user‚Äôs publicly available github gists and
create activity in Pipedrive for each gist. Application periodically
checks for a user's publicly available gists. 

Application has two web endpoints
* First shows all users that have been scanned.
* Second shows the gists for that user that were added since the last visit.

### Stack:
 * üêç Python 3.10 for scanning gists
 * Flask 2.1.3 for simple server
 * üêã Docker + Docker Compose


### How to run the application
1. Specify the `USER_LIST_TYPE` environment variable to either `env` or `file`
   - If `USER_LIST_TYPE` is `env` then specify users in the `USER_LIST` environment variable as comma seperated list. For example `USER_LIST: user1,user2,user3`
   - If `USER_LIST_TYPE` is `file` then add users to the `scanner/input/users.txt` file.
2. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the github token for the user.
3. Set the `PIPEDRIVE_TOKEN` environment variable to the pipedrive token for the user.
4. Run the application with `docker-compose up` üöÄ
5. Check the application logs üìú and your Pipedrive activities list üìù

### Endpoints

There are Bearer Token Authorization.

Default token is `token`. You can set your own token by setting the `BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable for the server.
* `/users` - Shows all users that have been scanned.
* `/user/<username>` - Shows the gists for that user that were added since the last visit.
